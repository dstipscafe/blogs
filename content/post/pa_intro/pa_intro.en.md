## Introduction and Project Goals

Project Amaterasu is a project focused on time-series forecasting. We aim to use deep learning algorithms to predict highway traffic volumes. Initially, the project will concentrate on highway traffic data, and as more data becomes available, we plan to incorporate weather and other relevant features for training.
